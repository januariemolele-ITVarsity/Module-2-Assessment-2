                    <h1>HOT SEAT</h1>
                    <p>Wallace Reed, veteran bomb squad officer, rushes to a city park where a bomb has just exploded creating a mass panic.

                    In a nearby building, Orlando Friar, a super-hacker turned IT Support, receives a call. Heʼs sitting on an explosive device, big enough to vaporise his entire office building. Standing up would trigger the bomb and the clock is ticking. Directed by a mysterious voice on the phone, Orlando is forced to access the millions of dollars in hedge fund accounts that heʼs paid to protect. Bombs are armed all around him keeping the police away, as the voice keeps up the pressure, forcing him to focus. Reed is on scene and discovers the larger plot just before S.W.A.T. snipers and police, who believe Orlando is a domestic terrorist, stage a full assault on the building.

                    With bigger explosives hidden throughout the city putting millions of people at risk, Reed and Orlando must work together to outwit the mastermind and save the day.</p>
